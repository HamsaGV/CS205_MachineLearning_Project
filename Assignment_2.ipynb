    "# Image Text Extraction and Information Retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Question\n",
    "\n",
    "Being able to take pictures of text, recognize, convert into computer text, and search either typed or hand-written is a very interesting and useful concept.\n",
    "**How can we use python image processing and information retrieval libraries to extract text from images and search through the results with specific queries?**\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Our data consists of **typed and hand-written document images and scans**. We created a dataset that is combined from multiple other datasets. It consists of approximately **1509 data points.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Since all these images have different document styles and structures, we want to see how well the image text detection library we're using will be able to convert the document into computer text thus allowing us to search through the documents. We will not be implementing the document image word extraction or the search engine from scratch, but we will be using multiple libraries in order to see how these machine learning and natural language processing concepts and libraries work.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Our Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "Since some characters share similar features with other characters, and handwritten characters are less consistent than typed characters, we expect a higher accuracy rate when we convert images with typed text to regular text than when we convert images with handwritten text to regular text.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Bother?\n",
    "\n",
    "Teaching a machine to recognize physical typed and hand-written documents from pictures and scans as well as being able to search through these documents is a very important and useful machine learning concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many applications such as being able to scan these documents into a database and being able to search for information within the documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "### PIL, Pytesseract\n",
    "\n",
    "We first loaded in the machine learning libraries. **PIL** allows us to process the images. **Pytesseract** allows us to convert the text in the image into a text string. **Pandas** allows us to manipulate data frames easily. **Elasticsearch** allows us to initialize a search engine for our data."
