vies)

Contact respondents from Buffalo and Kansas City who had previously participated
im a steak knife offer. This will consist of one cell of approximately 175 respondents
who are Triumph most often smokers/triers. This study is-intended to provide us with
any negatives associated with Triumph. Banner points will include Triumph most often
smokers (we anticipate approximately 25 most often people), switchers avay from Triumph
| (N approximately 45). It should be noted that an action standard of at least 50% be
obtained in acting upon any product negatives associated with these groups-—see

Tesearch limitations below for additional action standard.

(See attached meno)

 

Rey Criteria For Analysis

= Triumph switchers asked why no longer snoking Triumph
~ Present smokers of Triumph asked reasons for switching to Triumph
~ Mentions. of ""harshness""

 

 

Research Limitations
Due to sample size and experience we feel 25 respondents will presently be Triumph
smokers. An action standard of 75% should be utilized for judgments on product negatives
only among this group.
If 75% of Triumph smokers mention “harshne
50-75% of Triumph smokers mentién ""harshnes:
ook at other areas).

RE: CIGARETTE QUESTIONNAIRE.

 

 

Here is yet another version of the questionnaire. Please note that the last 2 pages are
the alternate versions that we discussed. Take a look at the alternate 09 to try to get at

the intensity issue, and maybe we can improve on it from here.

By the way, we recelved 13 more signature cards today and sent the cigarettes out. We
‘are now up to.74 respondents who have been sent cigarettes. Hopetully we wil get a lot

of callbacks this weekend.
Talk to you Monday. Thanks

SUGGESTION/SOLUTION FORK

 

Nane/Phone Ext.: M. Hamann, P, Harper, P, Martinez Date: __9/3/92
Supervisor/Manager: J. S. Wigand RED Group: _Licensee

Suggestion: Discontinue coal retention analyses on Licensee submitted
product sauples. (Note: Coal Retention testing is not
performed by most licensees. Other B&W physical
Toasurements as ends stability and inspection for soft
spots in cigarettes are thought to be sufficient measures
to assure cigarctte physical integrity. The proposed
action will increase laboratory productivity.)

Suggested Solution(s): Delete coal retention from the list of standard
analyses performed on licensee submitted
Product sauples. Speciel requests for coat
Zetention testing could still be submitted on
an exception basis.

Have you contacted your Manager/Supervisor? Yes No

Manager Connents: Manager, please contact suggester and forward

PROJEGT DESCRIPTION

The Cigarette Test Station (0TS400).combines many of the stand-alone instruments that

R&D currently uses to measure cigarette weight, pressure drop, ventilation, and

hardness into one compact module. The CTS400 has the additional measurement of

edgarette hardness in comparison with the C1S300. With this added measurement R&D will »
de able to replace the Firmess Integrator that measures cigarette firmess in addition

to other measurements that are mentioned above. The Firrness Integrator is no longer
manufactured and parts are becoming difficult to obtain. Lastly, purchase of thie

instrument vould provide similar capability as the Macon Plant and help facilitate
comparisions between laboratories.

DESIGN ON DISPLAY: (Condition And Rendition of Copy)

COMMENTS: (Description of Location or Rotary Plan, Brand Category Competition)

This is a comparatively easy market to cover. It is less than an hour from Tampa
airport. Our bulletins are on every major arterial and in all quadrants of the area.
No changes were made. Some minor on-premise blocking and trees were noted, but not
deemed serious enough for correction.

The only other tobacco in the market was a standing 6 Panel RJR buy currently showing
Camel.

‘COMMENTS ON PLANT: (Condition, Structures, Painting Abily, Lighting, Cooperation, etc.)

The plant is well maintained and covers all parts of the market. Lamar looks like a
good citizen here, keeping a good-looking operation. doing public service, and
carrying a lot of local advertisers.
